# FED CSS Hack App

Prompted by FED team discussion surrounding [The State of CSS 2021](https://2021.stateofcss.com/en-US/demographics)

## Overview

Evaluate, design, and apply styles to a basic React application using any mix of pre-processors, CSS frameworks, CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, styled components, etc. to achieve the desired outcome. In addition to the challenge itself is a chance to try unfamiliar tools and techniques to decide if they should be considered for future work.

## Objectives

• Create a consistent Look & Feel to a React app that includes Login, Signup, Profile (read-only and edit variations), with Cloudinary upload for profile images.
• Utilize a pre-processor and any mixture of other CSS techniques to create a UI that supports rapid development
• Learn about tools and techniques that may be new or unfamiliar

## Judging Categories

1. Best visual implementation of UI look & feel
2. Best/cleanest code structure (components, markup, styles, classes, files, etc.)
3. Best developer experience (subjective, based on presentations)

## Rules

1. Must have 3 screens minimum: Login, Signup, Profile. Can convert any of them to modals, if desired.
2. Profile must have two modes: read-only vs edit. Edit mode allows changing display name and/or profile photo URL.
3. You may modify HTML and/or components in any way desired. You can reuse, modify, or recreate any element as you wish. Add any classNames, ids, inline styles, etc.
4. No outside help coding. You can, however, seek help with any kind of configuration settings, module installation, environment errors, react questions, advice, etc.
5. Must utilize at least one third-party CSS utility/tool/technique. In other words, don't just use vanilla CSS for this one.
6. Must demonstrate the app (locally) and give your opinion on the developer experience you created.
7. You may add any other npm modules you want.

## Setup

Setup _should_ be as easy as running two commands:

1. `yarn`; or `npm install` if you prefer
2. `yarn start`; or `npm run start` if using npm
3. create-react-app supports SASS out of the box, so you can immediately use sass and/or css files. If you intended to use less, there is a separate script that will also watch less files for changes. Run `yarn start:less` or `npm run start:less`
4. If you are adding other frameworks, you may need to adjust the run script accordingly.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
